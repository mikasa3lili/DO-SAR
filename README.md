# Abstract

Point-based 3D detection approaches usually suffer from the severe point sampling imbalance problem between foreground and background. We observe that prior works have attempted to alleviate this imbalance by emphasizing foreground sampling. However, even adequate foreground sampling may be extremely unbalanced between nearby and distant objects, yielding unsatisfactory performance in detecting distant objects. To tackle this issue, this paper first proposes a novel method named Distant Object Augmented Set Abstraction and Regression (DO-SA&R) to enhance distant object detection, which is vital for the timely response of decision-making systems like autonomous driving. Technically, our approach first designs DO-SA with novel distant object augmented farthest point sampling (DO-FPS) to emphasize sampling on distant objects by leveraging both object-dependent and depth-dependent information. Then, we propose distant object augmented regression to reweight all the instance boxes for strengthening regression training on distant objects. In practice, the proposed DO-SA&R can be easily embedded into the existing modules, yielding consistent performance improvements, especially on detecting distant objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on the popular KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets, and DO-SA&R demonstrates superior performance, especially for distant object detection.
